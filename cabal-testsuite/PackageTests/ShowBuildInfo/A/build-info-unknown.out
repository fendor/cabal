cabal: Internal error in target matching. It should always be possible to find a syntax that's sufficiently qualified to give an unambiguous match. However when matching 'exe:B'  we found exe:B (unknown-component) which does not have an unambiguous syntax. The possible syntax and the targets they match are as follows:
'exe:B' which matches exe:B (unknown-component), :pkg:exe:lib:exe:module:B (unknown-module), :pkg:exe:lib:exe:file:B (unknown-file)
