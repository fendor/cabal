Error: cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: InvalidDep-0.1.0.0 (user goal)
[__1] trying: another-framework-0.8.1.1 (dependency of InvalidDep)
[__2] next goal: base (dependency of another-framework)
[__2] rejecting: base-<VERSION>/installed-<HASH> (conflict: another-framework => base<3 && >=3)
[__2] fail (backjumping, conflict set: another-framework, base)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: another-framework (3), InvalidDep (2), base (2)
