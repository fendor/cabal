synopsis: Redesign 'cabal path' command to account for projects
packages: cabal-install
prs: #9673

description: {

Previously, `cabal path` was only able to query from the global configuration file, e.g., `~/.cabal/config` or the XDG equivalent.
We take the foundations and enhance `cabal path` to take project configuration, such as `cabal.project`, into account.

Additionally, we add support for multiple output formats, such as key-value pairs and json.

The key-value pair output prints a line for each queried key and its respective value:

    key1: value2
    key2: value2

If only a single key is queried, we print only the value, for example:

    value1

The json output format is versioned by the cabal-install version, which is part of the json object.
Thus, all result objects contain at least the key "cabal-install-version".

We expand the `cabal path` to also produce information of the compiler that is going to be used in a `cabal build` or `cabal repl` invocation.
To do that, we re-configure the compiler program, and outputs the location, version and compiler flavour.
This is helpful for downstream tools, such as HLS, to figure out the GHC version required to compile a project with, without dependency solving.
